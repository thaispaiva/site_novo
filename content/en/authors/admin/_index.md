I have been a professor at the Department of Statistics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) since 2016. My research interests include **Bayesian Statistics**, **Imputation Methods for Synthetic Data**, **Data Confidentiality** and **Spatial Statistics**.

I have a degree in Actuarial Science from UFMG, a Master's in Statistics also from UFMG, and a PhD in Statistics from Duke University, USA.

Some of my research projects include simulating synthetic geographic coordinates for confidential databases, imputation of multivariate continuous variables under nonignorable missingness, and adaptive survey design.
